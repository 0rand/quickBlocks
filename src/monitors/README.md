# quickBlocks Monitors

This folder contains examples of monitors built for particular smart contracts. In each case, the 'parselib' folder has been automatically generated from the provided smart contract address. Please see the makefile for information on creating and building the 'parselib' code. The main.cpp file in each case shows different possibilities when interacting with a smart contract off line.
